# Introduction to HTML and CSS exercise

In this two-part exercise, you'll create two HTML pages (and related CSS pages):

1. A fan page for something that you like. The fan page can be for your favorite movie or TV show, your favorite sports team, or your favorite band.
2. An HTML form to submit some information about yourself.

Some other ideas for fan pages might include:

* Your favorite book or book series
* Your favorite character from a book, movie, or TV show
* Your favorite actor
* Your favorite comic book character
* Your favorite video game or video game series
* Your favorite coding bootcamp program

For your fan page, you must display a title, picture, and some different information. For your information form, you must use the appropriate form elements for the data listed in the requirements section.

## Learning objectives

After completing this exercise, you'll understand:

* How to create HTML content using semantic HTML elements.
* How to create HTML forms to accept user input.
* How to use CSS to apply styling to elements on an HTML page.

## Evaluation criteria and functional requirements

* Your page displays using Live Server within Visual Studio Code.
* All tests pass as expected.

## Getting started

1. Read the requirements for parts one and two.
2. Open the `exercise` folder in VS Code.
3. If this is the first time you have viewed this exercise, in a VS Code terminal window, type:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This prepares the testing software (Cypress) to run, and it may take a few minutes to complete.
4. Right-click on `index.html` and select **Open with Live Server** to view your page. Do the same with `info.html` when you're working on part two.
5. Write HTML and CSS as needed to satisfy the requirements.
6. Run the tests at any time using one of the following commands in a terminal window:
    * `npm run test` - Opens the Cypress UI, which allows you to run tests and view results interactively.
    * `npm run test-headless` - Doesn't open the Cypress UI, but runs the tests and displays results in the terminal window. This is a quicker way to run tests.
7. Repeat until all tests pass.

> **Note:** In the unlikely event that the Cypress testing software fails to run correctly, try re-installing it. Make sure you're in the folder where you ran `npm run test` or `npm run test-headless` and enter the following at the command prompt:<br/>`npx cypress install --force`

 ## Part 1: Fan page requirements

 ### General requirements
 
* In the `exercise` folder, open `index.html` to create your fan page.
* Create a CSS file, either in the same folder or in a `css` subfolder, and link to it from your `index.html` page.

* When you must add formatting to your page, include the appropriate CSS rules in the linked CSS file. Don't use HTML elements for formatting.
 
 ### Document structure

* Your document must have a meaningful title that appears as the browser tab's text.
* Your document must link to a separate `.css` file which contains style rules.
* Your document must have a background color that's different than the default background of white.
  * You may need to change the text color so it stands out from the new background.
* Your document must have a header area in which you display the main page heading.
* Your document must have a main area which displays your page content.

### Main page heading

* `quotes-section` must include two or three quotes using the appropriate semantic element. 
  * Examples include your favorite song lyrics or your favorite TV character's quotes.
* You must use CSS—not HTML—to italicize the quote elements.

### Links section

* Create a CSS file, either in the same folder or in a `css` subfolder, and link to it from your `info.html` page.
* Use semantic HTML to organize content.
* When you must add formatting to your page, include the appropriate CSS rules in the linked CSS file. Don't use HTML elements for formatting.

### Document structure

* Your document must have a meaningful title that appears as the browser tab's text.
* Your document must link to a separate `.css` file which contains style rules.

### Form

* Your page must have a form element which contains all the controls for the user to enter data.
